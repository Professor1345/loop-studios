## Overview

### HTML

### Overview

The HTML code (index.html) is the main structure of the website, defining the layout, content, and structure. Here's a brief overview of the main sections:

- First Box: Contains the navigation bar, logo, and an impactful message.
- Second Box: Showcases an interactive VR image along with a description of Loop Studios.
- Third Box: Presents various creations by Loop Studios.

### Tailwind CSS

### Overview

The Tailwind CSS code (styles.css) complements the HTML by providing styling and responsiveness. Here's a summary of key sections in the CSS:

- First Box Styling: Applies background images, text styles, and responsive padding to the first box.
- Second Box Styling: Defines flex layouts, image styles, and positioning for the second box components.
- Third Box Styling: Styles the creation cards, including background gradients and hover effects.
  Navigation Styling: Defines styles for the desktop and mobile navigation bars.

### JavaScript

### Overview

The JavaScript code (code.js) enhances the website's interactivity, primarily focusing on mobile navigation. Here's what the JavaScript does:

- Mobile Navigation: Implements functions (openButton and closeButton) to toggle the display of the mobile navigation when the respective buttons are clicked.
- Responsive Navigation: Includes commented-out code attempting to handle navigation visibility based on screen width, but currently disabled.

## The Challenges

I face alot of challenges while coding this project.
From the starting point;

- First Box

I faced the issue of hover where I made use of pseudo element ::before instead of straight border. It is neccesary if I wanted to follow the design provided.

I encountered the issue of height for responsiveness, but later solved it.

- Second Box

This is where I had major issues. The overlay (i.e textbox over image box) took me more than a day to complete.

I also had issue with the flexbox ðŸ˜„. I miscalculated some flex styles.

I had issue with the hover on the boxes, but solved it.

- Third Box

I had some miscalculation issue here, flex-box cal, you get? ðŸ˜‰

Likewise add minor issue with hover here too. Got to know one can't use ::before with font-awesome (according to what I experience).
